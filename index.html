          Overview
        </h3>

        <p>
          Expect to find incomplete projects and experiments touching on some of my favorite topics: <b>Computer Graphics</b>, <b>OpenGL</b>, <b>Unity</b> and other flavors usually for the sake of gaming.  You'll likely find less of some of my other favorite topics since all the REALLY good stuff is private and due to professional conflict of interest with my Corporate Mothership: <b>Mobile</b>, <b>Android</b>, <b>iOS</b>, <b>Rest-like services</b>.
          If I have a choice, most code will be in the form of C, C++, Java, or C#, but you'll probably run into some naughtier skills such as Perl, Bash, Javascript and the like.

          About Me
        </h3>

        <p>
          I am a husband.<br/>
          I am soon to be a father (as of Aug, 2015).<br/>
          I am an engineer, a scientist and a nerd.<br/>
          I am a gamer.
          I am a photographer.<br/>
          I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontharris">Principal Software Engineer and Architect</a> for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protrade.sportacular">Yahoo Sports - Android</a><br/>
        </p>

          Credentials
        </h3>

        <p>
          I have an Art Degree, not a CS Degree.  You see, I wanted to be a photographer...<br/>
          I minored in Computer Science and eventually took every upper division CS Course available -- I still do not have a CS Degree as I never completed Calc II-IV.<br/>
          Why does that matter?  Because it is my art that makes me a great engineer.  More important than code, is abstract thought, balance, symmetry, flow, comprehension and expression.  What good is code, if it is not creative?<br/>
          I am a Certified Professional Photographer certified by <a href="https://www.nyip.edu/courses/professional-photography">NYIP</a>.<br>

          I began coding ~1985 with Tandy-Basic on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer">Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer II</a>
          
          I began mobile development ~1998 with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_OS">Palm</a> development and took an interest in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Runtime_Environment_for_Wireless">BREW</a>, <a href="http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169?sc=stm32">STM32</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-51">8051</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a> until I found iOS and Android in 2008 after which I've never touched another mobile platform :/
